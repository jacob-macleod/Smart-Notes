# smart_notes

This is a notes app made in flutter

## Branches
* `main` is used for full releases
* `development` is used for active development
  * Features in development are pushed to `<feature_name> #issue_number`. Once features are developed they are pushed to development
* Other branches are used to develop full features before pushing to the `development` branch
  * The branches are named with the convention of type #issue_number
  * The commits are named with the convention of type: description #issue_number
  * One branch should be created per issue
